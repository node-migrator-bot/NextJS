                    <h2>What is the Next JS Project?</h2>
                    <p>The user who grew familiar with the account method of Ext JS /Sencha Touch, and was familiar with it offers the function in which server side programming can be performed so that a client code may be described.</p>
                    <p>The class group as the fundamental function and MVC framework as a Web server is offered. 
Didn't you introduce node and feel a quite simple, high-speed, and infinite possibility? However, probably, he has noticed that it is necessary to mount by oneself from the function as a Web server, in order to actually have created application simultaneously. 
While Next JS offers such platforms, since it becomes the optimal back end (server side) of Ext JS /Sencha Touch, development is furthered. 
Of course, since even development of a HTML base is equipped with the Smarty-like template engine which PHP may be sufficient as and is used, it is satisfactory. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
Since the adapter of MongoDB is mounted as a client side, a server side, and a database adapter by using Next JS, even database operation is completed only by JavaScript. 
Though natural, use which changed the database to MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. can also be performed. 
Development is furthered for the purpose of the application server & framework which can mount application thought of easily. 
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                    Do you remember that it was very exciting with Ext JS when the first? And thing disappointed about that another language on a server side must be used when finishing setting up application by ExtJS. 
Please feel easy. 
In mist, that frame frame came to the server side. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
Although it is a framework which operates on node, itself Next JS   It is a Web server and also an application server. 
Although the server side of Ext JS is written from now on, neither PHP nor Java is needed. 
Even Apache is not needed for a surprising thing. 
(It is not useless [ using many languages by a development use ], of course.) If node and Next JS are installed, it can write by JavaScript on a server side as well as a client side. 
And the same account method as Sencha Touch /ExtJS can be used. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Strong cooperation with ExtJS / Sencha Touch</h3>
                    <p>
A one programmer sometimes often takes over not only a client side but coding of a server side in case of the case of a small project. 
The human being who was writing JavaScript by the client until a while ago forgets $ of the variable identifier of PHP in spite of himself, and generates a barren error. 
If it is Next JS, since a server side is also the same language, such worries are not needed. 
And since the design concept of Ext JS is followed, if it is an engineer of Ext JS, any sense of incongruity cannot be found and it can code. 
Next JS (correctly Next Core) corresponds to the new class system introduced [ especially ] from Ext JS 4 completely. 
The variable created by global object called Ext is transposed to NX, and is only considered. 
It is also the feature that Ext JS and wonderful cooperation can be taken. 
It corresponds to the call of the server side by ExtDirect which is one of the strong points of Ext JS completely. 
Since a server side is also JavaScript, delivery of data can make sense of incongruity there be completely nothing. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>MVC Model</h3>
                    <p>
Next JS has realized MVC (Model-View-Controller) on the server side. 
Module can be connected with the table of a database and can also connect an association to other tables. 
Contoroller can manage a session or can treat two or more Module(s). 
And Action method each of Contoroller(s) will be 1 page of your site. 
In View, a template can be created with a Smarty-like form. 
Single of putting the portion of M of MVC on a server side, and solving all others on a client side in ExtDirect action which cooperates with ExtDirect   Page   Application   The composition which dies the royal road can be taken. 
If an ExtDirect controller is used, the public method of Module can call from ExtDirect as it is. 
And the head family Sencha is also due to be supported also about Direct access from Sencha Touch which is not supported the present place. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Next Generation</h3>
                    <p>
WebSocet which attracts attention also in HTML5 can also be used by Next JS. 
If WebSocet is used, true two-way communication will become possible. 
it is not yet kiln in order to know the change of state by the side of a server -- it is not necessary to send a HTTP request repeatedly as it is 
It can communicate with a client with many correspondence procedures from the function as a very ordinary Web server to Ext.Direct and WebSocet. 
It means that this can be broadly built to the complicated Web application which many users visit and which took hold on business deeply from the general site.

                    <h2>How can I use it?</h2>
                    <p>In order to use Next JS, the environment where node and npm are installed is required. 
In order to begin from the place referred to as there being no environment and touching node after this, a recommendation looks through a Next JS environmental construction guide. 
Those who already have environment need to install Next JS by npm as follows. 
The package name of Next JS is nx. </p>

                    <h2>About License</h2>
                    <p>Since it is provided with the MIT license, Next JS can be used freely. 
Moreover, it is developed as an open source project by GitHub. 
Doesn't the direction which got interested in development develop together with us? 
Still more, although development environment and a procedure are unripe, if it can complete with various developers, we will think that we are glad. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is since the mailing list (nextjs@googlegroups.com) was created.   I am pleased if you perform information dissemination by users. </p>
