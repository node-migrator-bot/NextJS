                        What is Next JS Project?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                    Next JS Project provides the user who becomes accustomed to the notation of Ext JS/Sencha Touch with the function that executes the server side programming to describe the client code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Next JS Project provides the basic function as the Web server and the class group as MVC framework. Didn’t you feel very simple, high-speed, infinite possibility after introducing node ? However at the same time you must have noticed that it is necessary to implement by yourself rather than by the function as the Web server to actually create the application.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Next JS provides such platform, and is under development to become the best back end of Ext JS/Sencha Touch (server side). Of course Next JS enables development of HTML with Smarty-like template engine that is often used with PHP.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    As the adaptor of MongoDB is implemented as the client side, server side, and a data base adaptor by using Next JS the database is totally operated only with JavaScript. Naturally, you can switch the data base to MySQL and PostgreSQL, etc. Now we are on the way of development aiming at application server & framework that can easily implement application hit on one’s mind.

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                    You remember having gotten excited very much experiencing Ext JS for the first time ? And you must be disappointed because it is necessary to use another language on the server side when assembling the application with ExtJS. Never mind. New exciting tool came to the server side. Next JS is the framework that operates on node but is itself the Web server and also the application server. From now on neither PHP nor Java is needed to write the server side of Ext JS. Surprisingly, even Apache is unnecessary. (naturally several languages can be used due to the development usage.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
If node and Next JS are installed, it is possible to write with JavaScript even on the server side just like the client side. Moreover, the same notation as Sencha Touch/ExtJS can be used.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Strong cooperation with ExtJS/Sencha Touch</h3>
                    <p>
There are often cases that single programmer undertakes coding on not only the client side but also the server side in the small project. The client who kept writing JavaScript inadvertently forgets the variable identifier $ of PHP and often causes a barren error. In the case of Next JS since the server side is the same language as the client side such problem never happens.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Moreover, since the system design of Next JS follows the one of Ext JS an engineer of Ext JS can do coding without any sense of incompatibility. Especially, Next JS (Next Core precisely) completely corresponds to the new class system introduced from Ext JS 4. It is enough only by replacing the variable created on the global object named Ext with on NX. The feature is to perfectly cooperate with Ext JS.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It completely corresponds to the call of the server side by ExtDirect that is one of merits of Ext JS. As the server side is by JavaScript, data can be completely delivered without any sense of incompatibility.
                    </p>
                    <h3>MVC Model</h3>
                    <p>
Next JS has achieved MVC(Model-View-Controller) on the server side. Module is tied up with the table of the data base, and can connect other tables with Association. Contoroller can manage the session and deal with multiple Modules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Also each one of the Action method of Contoroller becomes one page of your site. In View, the template can be made with the Smarty-like format.
                    </p>
                    <p>
On the ExtDirect action that is cooperated with ExtDirect, we can configure the authentic method of the single page application in which the part of M of MVC is placed on the server side, and the rest is solved on the client side. Using ExtDirect controller, the public method of Module can be called from ExtDirect immediately.
                    </p>
                    <h3>To the next generation</h3>
                    <p>
WebSocet paid attention in HTML5 can be used with Next JS. Using WebSocet, the true bidirectional communication becomes possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
HTTP request need not be sent often to know the state change on the server side. It is possible to communicate with the client by various communication methods from the usual function as Web server to Ext.Direct, WebSocet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
This means that it is possible to widely construct general sites where a lot of users visit through complicated Web application closely related with business.

                    <h2>How to use ?</h2>
                    <p>
The environment in which node and npm are installed is necessary to use Next JS. In the case of no environment and for beginners of node, it is recommended to read through the Next JS environment construction guide. With the environment please install Next JS with npm. The package name of Next JS is nx.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Users of Cent OS 5/6 and Fedora 15/16 provide node, npm, and Next JS of RPM version. Registering the repository, it is possible to install from node to npm and Next JS by the batch by using yum.
                    </p>

                    <p>
As Next JS is provided by MIT license, it is possible to use it readily. Moreover, Next JS is developed with GitHub as open source project. We ask someone who is interested in development to work with us. Still, we are not mature in the development environment and the procedure, we are truly happy if we can make new tools together with various developers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In addition, we had mailing list (<a href="mailto:nextjs@googlegroups.com">nextjs@googlegroups.com</a>), so we hope users provide information mutually.
