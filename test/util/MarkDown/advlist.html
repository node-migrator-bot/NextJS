<p>You can put other Markdown blocks in a list; just indent four spaces for each nesting level.  So:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Lists in a list item:</p>

<ul><li>Indented four spaces.
<ul><li>indented eight spaces.</li></ul></li>
<li>Four spaces again.</li></ul></li>
<li><p>Multiple paragraphs in a list items:</p>

<p>It's best to indent the paragraphs four spaces
You can get away with three, but it can get
confusing when you nest other things.
Stick to four.</p>

<p>We indented the first line an extra space to align
it with these paragraphs.  In real use, we might do
that to the entire list so that all items line up.</p>

<p>This paragraph is still part of the list item, but it looks messy to humans.  So it's a good idea to wrap your nested paragraphs manually, as we did with the first two.</p></li>
<li><p>Blockquotes in a list item:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Skip a line and
  indent the >'s four spaces.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Preformatted text in a list item:</p>

<pre><code>Skip a line and indent eight spaces.
That's four spaces for the list
and four to trigger the code block.
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
