<p>If you need to do something that Markdown can't handle, you can always just use HTML:</p>

<p>Strikethrough humor is <strike>funny</strike>.</p>

<p>Markdown is smart enough not to mangle your span-level HTML:</p>

<p><u>Markdown works <em>fine</em> in here.</u></p>

<p>Block-level HTML elments have a few restrictions:</p>

<ol>
<li>They must be separated from surrounding text by blank
lines.</li>
<li>The begin and end tags of the outermost block element
must not be indented.</li>
<li>You can't use Markdown within HTML blocks.</li>
</ol>

<p>So:</p>

<div style="background-color: lightgray">
    You can <em>not</em> use Markdown in here.
</div>
