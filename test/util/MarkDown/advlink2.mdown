You can write bare URLs by enclosing them in angle brackets:

My web site is at <http://attacklab.net>.

If you use this format for email addresses, Showdown will encode the address to make it harder for spammers to harvest.  Try it and look in the *HTML Output* pane to see the results:

Humans can read this, but most spam harvesting robots can't: <me@privacy.net>
