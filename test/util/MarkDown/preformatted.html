<p>You can include preformatted text in a Markdown document.</p>

<p>To make a code block, indent four spaces:</p>

<pre><code>printf("goodbye world!");  /* his suicide note
                              was in C */
</code></pre>

<p>The text will be wrapped in <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags, and the browser will display it in a monospaced typeface.  The first four spaces will be stripped off, but all other whitespace will be preserved.</p>

<p>You cannot use Markdown or HTML within a code block, which makes them a convenient way to show samples of Markdown or HTML syntax:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;blink&gt;
   You would hate this if it weren't
   wrapped in a code block.
&lt;/blink&gt;
</code></pre>
