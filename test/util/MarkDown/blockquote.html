<h2>Simple blockquotes</h2>

<p>Blockquotes are indented:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The syntax is based on the way email programs
  usually do quotations. You don't need to hard-wrap
  the paragraphs in your blockquotes, but it looks much nicer if you do.  Depends how lazy you feel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Advanced blockquotes: Nesting</h2>

<p>You can put other Markdown blocks in a blockquote; just add a <code>&gt;</code> followed by a space:</p>

<p>Parragraph breaks in a blockquote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The > on the blank lines is optional.
  Include it or don't; Markdown doesn't care.</p>
  
  <p>But your plain text looks better to
  humans if you include the extra <code>&gt;</code>
  between paragraphs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blockquotes within a blockquote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A standard blockquote is indented</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>A nested blockquote is indented more</p>
    
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>You can nest to any depth.</p>
      </blockquote>

<p>Lists in a blockquote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>A list in a blockquote</li>
  <li>With a > and space in front of it
  <ul><li>A sublist</li></ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Preformatted text in a blockquote:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Indent five spaces total.  The first
one is part of the blockquote designator.
</code></pre>
