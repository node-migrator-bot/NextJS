Images are exactly like links, but they have an exclamation point in front of them:

 ![Valid XHTML] (http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10).

The word in square brackets is the alt text, which gets displayed if the browser can't show the image.  Be sure to include meaningful alt text for blind users' screen-reader software.

Just like links, images work with reference syntax and titles:

 This page is ![valid XHTML][checkmark].

 [checkmark]: http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10
           "What are you smiling at?"


**Note:**

Markdown does not currently support the shortest reference syntax for images:

  Here's a broken ![checkmark].

But you can use a slightly more verbose version of implicit reference names:

  This ![checkmark][] works.

The reference name (`valid icon`) is also used as the alt text.
