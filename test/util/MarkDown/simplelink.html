<p>There are three ways to write links.  Each is easier to read than the last:</p>

<p>Here's an inline link to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.
Here's a reference-style link to <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.
Here's a very readable link to <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a>.</p>

<p>The link definitions can appear anywhere in the document -- before or after the place where you use them.  The link definition names (<code>1</code> and <code>Yahoo!</code>) can be any unique string, and are case-insensitive; <code>[Yahoo!]</code> is the same as <code>[YAHOO!]</code>.</p>
