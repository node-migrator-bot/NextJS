Simple blockquotes
------------------

Blockquotes are indented:

> The syntax is based on the way email programs
> usually do quotations. You don't need to hard-wrap
> the paragraphs in your blockquotes, but it looks much nicer if you do.  Depends how lazy you feel.


Advanced blockquotes: Nesting
-----------------------------

You can put other Markdown blocks in a blockquote; just add a `>` followed by a space:

Parragraph breaks in a blockquote:

> The > on the blank lines is optional.
> Include it or don't; Markdown doesn't care.
>
> But your plain text looks better to
> humans if you include the extra `>`
> between paragraphs.


Blockquotes within a blockquote:

> A standard blockquote is indented
> > A nested blockquote is indented more
> > > > You can nest to any depth.


Lists in a blockquote:

> - A list in a blockquote
> - With a > and space in front of it
>     * A sublist

Preformatted text in a blockquote:

>     Indent five spaces total.  The first
>     one is part of the blockquote designator.
