<p>Images are exactly like links, but they have an exclamation point in front of them:
![hoge][dummy2]</p>

<p><img src="http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10" alt="Valid XHTML" title="" />.</p>

<p>The word in square brackets is the alt text, which gets displayed if the browser can't show the image.  Be sure to include meaningful alt text for blind users' screen-reader software.</p>

<p>Just like links, images work with reference syntax and titles:</p>

<p>This page is <img src="http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10" alt="valid XHTML" title="" />.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<p>Markdown does not currently support the shortest reference syntax for images:</p>

<p>Here's a broken !<a href="http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10" title="What are you smiling at?">checkmark</a>.</p>

<p>But you can use a slightly more verbose version of implicit reference names:</p>

<p>This <img src="http://w3.org/Icons/valid-xhtml10" alt="checkmark" title="" /> works.</p>

<p>The reference name (<code>valid icon</code>) is also used as the alt text.</p>
