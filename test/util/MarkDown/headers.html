<p>There are two ways to do headers in Markdown.  (In these examples, Header 1 is the biggest, and Header 6 is the smallest.)</p>

<p>You can underline text to make the two top-level headers:</p>

<h1>Header 1</h1>

<h2>Header 2</h2>

<p>The number of <code>=</code> or <code>-</code> signs doesn't matter; you can get away with just one.  But using enough to underline the text makes your titles look better in plain text.</p>

<p>You can also use hash marks for all six levels of HTML headers:</p>

<h1>Header 1</h1>

<h2>Header 2</h2>

<h3>Header 3</h3>

<h4>Header 4</h4>

<h5>Header 5</h5>

<h6>Header 6</h6>

<p>The closing <code>#</code> characters are optional.</p>
